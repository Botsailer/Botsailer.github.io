            <p style="font-size:2em;" id="wh">The growth of computer power has brought miraculous breakthroughs in hardware and
                software, which have in turn changed global behavior and culture. Computer science is responsible for
                smartphones, tablets, the internet and networked communications, even social media. We live in a society
                that consumes content – whether that be news, information, entertainment, or communication – through
                screens. We are truly living in a digital age, driven by computer science.</p>
